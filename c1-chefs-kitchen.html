      I had the pleasure of attending the final presentations for a new graduating cohort at DBC a couple of weeks ago. The joy that they were feeling was eveident in their body language as they presented the results of months of immpassioned dedication. Not only had they finally come to the end of en arduous journey, but they were also really proud of what they had created together. What start out as ideas were now at their fingertips, and would hopefully reach the hands of thousands of others. I was inspired not only by their creatins, but buy the visibly strong relationships that were formed throughout their process. I applied to Dev Bootcamp not only becasue they breed great web developers, but because they are constantly building a family of individuals who push each other towrds fulfulling their dreams and potential.

        Having a brother who has made his way through the program has given me a lot of insight as to what to expect, but there has still been some surprises about the experience so far. I have really enjoyed the focus that there has been on the betterment of the mind and body, as well as the encouragement that has been given to open up to fellow cohort members. I can already tell that the Sea Lion are full of genuine and driven people....I am looking forward to getting to know everyone in addition to learning about myself.

        While I am admittedly nervous about may aspects of this journey, I am excited about challenging myself outside of my comfort zone while gaining skills that will allow me to pursue and immensely rewarding career.
