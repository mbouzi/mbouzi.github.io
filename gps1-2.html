    	<h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
    	<p>A programming technique in which two programmers are working at one station. One programmer is the driver who is typing the code; the other programmer is the navigator who is checking the code and suggesting/saying what to type.

    	<h3>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h3>
    	<p>Pair programming is important because it can be a great learning tool. Also, many companies are starting to implement this technique and it's great to get some practice. It increases focus-level and helps both programmers learn - by either gaining new experience or reiterating what they already know. It's also important to DBC to help build our emotional empathy while working with other programmers, making sure things go smoothly and getting the best result between two people.

    	<h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
    	<p>The driver is the one who is actively typing the code and find solutions. The navigator is actively finding solutions and verbally guiding the driver as to what is being typed.
