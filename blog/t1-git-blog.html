        <p>A Version Control System allows one to keep track of the changes made to a file throughout the lifetime of a project. Every change that is made is tracked along with who made the change and why it was made. They are like check pints that can be revisited to prevent mistakes or bug issues.</p>
        
    <h6 style ="font-size: 24px">How git tracks changes</h6>
        <p>A set of files or directories that are under version control are called a repository. Changes are tracked by cloning a repository from a host using the command line locally on your computer. A change is first added to stanby, then can be titled by a messges and committed as a saved change. All commits can be viwed from a log and revisited using their associated number.</p>
    
    <h7 style ="font-size: 24px">Benefits of GitHub</h7>
        <p>GitHub is an online Version Control System that functions as a hub for stored files. Stored files can be shared with other users and pathways can be created locally from your computer to GitHub so that they may be accessed on the site. It is great tool for colaborative purposes; collaborators working on the same project can commit changes to the main branch on GitHub without interfering with each others wor. GitHub is an essential service for web developers.</p>
