        I had the pleasure of attending the final presentations for a new graduating cohort at DBC a couple of weeks ago. The joy that they were feeling was eveident in their body language as they presented the results of months of impassioned dedication. Not only had they finally come to the end of an arduous journey, but they were also really proud of what they had created together. What started out as ideas were now at their fingertips, and would hopefully reach the hands of thousands more. I was inspired not only by their creations, but by the visibly strong relationships that were formed throughout their process. I applied to Dev Bootcamp not only because they breed great web developers, but because they are constantly building a family of individuals who push each other towrds fulfilling their dreams and potential.

        Having a brother who has made his way through the program has given me a lot of insight as to what to expect, but there has still been some surprises about the experience so far. I have really enjoyed the focus that there has been on knowledge of self, emotional intelligence, and improvement of the mind and body. The encouragement to open up to fellow cohort members has already built a great communal atmosphere. I can already tell that the Sea Lions are full of genuine and driven people who are eager to make this a great experience.

        I am admittedly nervous about may aspects of this journey, but I am excited about challenging myself outside of my comfort zone and gaining skills that will allow me to pursue and immensely rewarding career.
