        Pair programming is an essential component of the curriculum at Dev Bootcamp. Many people assume that Web Development is a profession in which much of ones time will be spent solving problems on your own, and that is simply not the case. Web developers are required to be able to work in pairs and groups, and be able to do so productively. Not only will it most likely be an important facet of employment, it is great way to learn quickly and make fewer mistakes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Pair programming has been a very positive experience for me so far at DBC. I was a bit nervous about it before my first session. Emotional empathy is something we are encouraged to actively put into practice. It involves interaction that is friendly, open, and based on mutual trust and respect. In my experience my fellow cohorts have done a great job of adhering to these principles, which has made grow to enjoy pairing. I have been able to learn through a constant exchange of thoughts and knowledge, and it is immensely rewarding when a difficult challenge is conquered through team effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are required to give feedback to our pairs after each session, and rate each otherâ€™s feedback as well. If our peers believe our feedback is being kind, specific, and actionable, than the one receiving the feedback will be able to view it. I am pretty good with being fairly critical of myself, so I have yet to receive any really enlightening pieces of feedback. It feels good to get reassurance that you are performing at the level you believe that you are, for better or for worse. When I give feedback myself I try to give my pair specifics as to what they were doing right and how it contributed to my learning experience. I am lookin forward to having the experience of pairing in person in the next phase of this programming, and certainly hoping that I am still able to learn and contribute as effectively.
