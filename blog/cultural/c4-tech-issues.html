        Last year, Dana Severson and Nick Ciske co-founded Startups Anonymous, a forum in which people in the tech industry can post questions and concerns anonymously and recieve positive feedback. About half of the submissions on the forum have been about anxiety and depression. In the tech industry, depression is somethings that doesn't get discussed nearly enough. The pressure to succeed and fear of failure, especially amongst those involved in start-ups, can be cripling. Less than 10 percent of ventures succeed, and the competitiive nature of the industry discourages people from speaking up about their issues. Depression is not especially rampant in the tech industry; it is the leading cause of disablility worldwide and costs employers billions of dollars a year in lost revenue. Even so, there are elements of tech culture and start-up life especially that make people particularly susceptible to the disorder. With start-ups, in addition to the pressure to succeed there are long and irregular work hours, the fear of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars of other people's money, and for some, the responsibility of the livelihood of employees.

        With something like depression being a widespread issue in general, it is hard to point to solutions that can spark change in the culture of the industry. The reluctance to want to talk about such a personal issue is understandable, and a culture the promotes that projection of well-being even in the face of dispear can only worsen a sitution. I beleive that growth of forums such as Startups Anonymous are the best way forward right now for tackling this issue. Providing safe communities for those that feel alone is of the utmost importance, even if the members don't know each other. Leaders in the industry who have had these spells and experiences need to speak up as well. Whether it be through written work or public speaking, they may have enough influence to alter perceptions, promote dialogue, and bring the tech industry to a healthier mind-state.
