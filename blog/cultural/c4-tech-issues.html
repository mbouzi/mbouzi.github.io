        "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ablility to climb a tree, it will live its whole like believing that it is stupid". Everyone has there own talents, backgrounds and experiences. In order to excel, it may take the right environment or task that evoke the use of strenths rather than weakness. For example, being aware of your thinking style can make an immense difference in how efficiently information can be processed and understood. In terms of learning especially, potential can be maximized, stress levels can be reduced, and limitations of poor instructions can be overcome. Knowledge of your thinking style gives you insight into your habits, which in turn allows you to utilize your strengths be mindful of weaknesses.

        As an <em>Abstract Sequential</em> thinker, I am extremely analytical and adept in visulization and using my imagination. I  like to organize information in a linear fashion, analyze situations before making a decision, and apply logic in finding solutions to problems. I learn the best when I have access to experts or reference, and through discussion and sharing of ideas. So far at Dev Bootcamp, learning has been enjoyable due to the fact that I have been able to play to my strengths. We are encouraged to ask questions and have a plethora of resources available to get the answers. Through pairing, I am able learn through constant communication and exchange of knowledge. It has not been a completely smooth expereince; there are times when I am completely out of my comfort zone. With this thinking style comes discomfort when expressing or discussing feelings and emotions. This is an aspect of the programs I was looking forward to facing, and it encouraging to see myself improving on my weaknesses.

        Having a growth mindset rather than a fixed one is another way in which knowledge of self can lead to higher levels of success. I myself have teetered between these two attitudes throughout my life, perhaps even leaning more towards fixed. I felt that I knew my strengths, and at times did not give my all in areas where I had not had the success I wanted in the past. Maybe it is becasue this is something I am passionate about, but most of my fixed-mindset tendencies haven't crept up throughout DBC. Once piece of advice that someone gave has definiely helped me keep a positive attitude. Everyone is going to have their stregnths and weakness; one person might seem to grasp something easier than you are able to, but there will be something that you excel in more than most.
