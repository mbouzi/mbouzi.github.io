        My parents are from Haiti. Like most other immigrants from this nation, my parents raised their children in a strict household. Friends contorted their faces in shock when I told them of the rules that I had to abide by to "survive". Looking back now I am actually happy that I was raised that way, but at the time many conflicts arouse due to my siblings and I not seeing eye to eye with my parents.
      </p>

                Everyone is family has a short temper, even small disagreements have the potential to turn into a shouting match. One topic that was a constant source of conflict in my family was attire. In Haiti, appearance considered as a very serious representation of ones family. There is no leaving the house in sweats to go to a friends house down the block, one must look presentable at all times. There were many times where my parents did not think that what I wanted to wear to school was a representation of how they raised me to be. Honestly to this day this is a topic that we still struggle with.
      </p>

                While in the past these arguments ended with me reluctantly changing my clothes, I am now of an age where basically I wear what I want to wear. I try to be understanding that my parents grew up in a different time, place and mindset. his understanding does not come across during arguments because of how adamant each side is about their point. I am still trying to learn to how to handle these situations with more maturity and empathy. I think the first step would be to remain calm throughout a disagreement and make sure that respect is being given at all times while trying to argue a point. These experiences with my parents have taught me that you never know how someoneâ€™s experience or past experiences could affect their actions and mindset. One must every situation with an open mind, because through empathy teachable moments and exchange of knowledge can occur.
