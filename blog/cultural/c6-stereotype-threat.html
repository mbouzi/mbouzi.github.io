        Stereotype threat is the feeling of being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group one identifies with. For example, several experiments have shown that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, Black students performed better and equivalently to their White peers. Everything from confidence and happiness to academic performance can be harmed by this fear that ones behavior will be judged on the basis of negative stereotypes.

        During my last couple of years of college, stereotype threat became something that was regularly at the forefront of my thoughts. I began to realize how lucky I was to grow up in Queens, New York, where my schools were so diverse I believed that the demographics were evenly split amongst races. While in college it took me a little while to notice what was different about the mindset of the people I was surrounded with. It wasn't just the fact that I was now part of an obvious minority, but it was the way I was being treated. I began to notice some people were not comfortable around me; people avoiding eye contact, not responding to me at all, or even making inappropriate comments had become expected. I found the diversity of my friend circles dwindled as the years went by. I told myself that it was ignorance or that some people just weren't used to interacting with people like me, but it was tiring for me to have to change my demeanor in order to accommodate those around me. The feeling that I did not belong in that environment certainly kept me from having the social experience and academic performance that I might otherwise have had in a more diverse environment.

        I believe that the first step towards combating stereotype threat is being aware of its existence. Stereotypes, in most cases, are nothing more than inaccurate generalizations. Belief in ones own ability and worth can go a long ways towards building a strong mindset.
