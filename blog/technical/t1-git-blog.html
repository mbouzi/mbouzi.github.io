      <h4><u>Version Control</u></h4>
        <p>A <b>Version Control System</b> allows one to keep track of the changes made to a file throughout the lifetime of a project. Every change that is made is tracked along with who made the change and why it was made. They are like check pints that can be revisited to prevent mistakes or bug issues. Git is a very popular VCS amongst web developers.</p>
              
        <h4><u>How git tracks changes</u></h5>
          <p>A set of files or directories that are under version control are called a <b>repository</b>. Changes can be tracked using <b>Git</b> by <em>cloning</em> a repository from a host using the <b>command line</b> locally on your computer. A change is first <em>added</em> to standby, then can be titled by a messges and <em>committed</em> as a saved change. All commits can be viwed from a log and revisited using their associated number.</p>

      <h4><u>Git on Command Line</u></h4>
          <p><b>git init</b></p>
            <p> Will create a git repository so you can get started.</p>
          <p><b>git add</b></p>
            <p> Used to stage all of your changes.</p>
          <p><b>git commit -m "commit message"</b></p>
            <p> Tells Git that you have made changes.</p>
          <p><b>git push</b></p>
            <p> Pushed changes to a remote branch such as GitHub.</p>
          <p><b>git status</b></p>
            <p> Provides information such as what files have been added, untracked, and staged.</p>
          <p><b>git log</b></p>
            <p> Displays all of the changes you have made so far.</p>
        
      <h4><u>Benefits of GitHub</u></h4>
          <p>GitHub is an online Version Control System that functions as a hub for stored files. Stored files can be shared with other users and pathways can be created locally from your computer to GitHub so that they may be accessed on the site. It is great tool for collaborative purposes; collaborators working on the same project can commit changes to the main branch on GitHub without interfering with each others work. GitHub is an essential service for web developers.</p>
