        Within the Object-Oriented programming language Ruby, <<em>classes</em> provide a blueprint for objects. Programs can define and operate to reflect real-world concepts such as "animals", "books", or anything else. When designing a class, one should think about what the object should know about itself, and what the object does. The things that an object knows about itself are called <em>instance variables</em>, which represent the objects state and have unique values for each object of that type. The things that an object can do are called <em>methods</em>.

          In this example I created the class <b>Player</b> from which soccer athlete objects will be created. Within the method <b>#initialize</b>, I created the attributes that represent data that the players will know about themselves. These are also called instance variables, and they can be used anywhere within the scope of the class. Every player object will be born with data representing these attributes, for example a player named "Silva" can play for the team "Spain" or "Manchester City". The method underneath, <b>#shoot</b>, represents an action that the players can perform. If their accuracy is over 60(%), they will score when they shoot, if not they will miss. In addition to this method, there are many other method that every object has access to. A list of methods can be display by calling <b>#methods</b> to an object.

          Here, I created two players and gave them their own attributes. These attributes must be given in the specific order they were initialized in in this situation, or you will get an error message suggesting there are the wrong number of arguments, in this case 3. I also called the #shoot method on the two players. If the method was defined properly, one of them will shoot, and one will score based on their accuracy attribute.

          Theo must be a forward becasue he was able to score, and Flamini need to spend a little more time in the training ground. Maybe next time I will create a goalkeeper to make their task even harder!
